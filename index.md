# Welcom greeet！

Greeet helps you easily checkin your guest and manage the list on site, you only need to import the excel guest list to the app to start.

#### :closed_lock_with_key: privacy and data safty

Unlike traditional guest list / check-in software, Greeet does not rely on network connections, and you can still use all features without internet connection. At the same time, GREET also **does not save your guest list on the server**. You can download Excel to make subsequent data reports.
