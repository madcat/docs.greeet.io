## Getting Started with your first event

### prepare guest list

You can download a sample guest list:
[!file sample](assets/sample-list.xlsx)

Besides texts columns, when a column has repeated values, it will be imported as a selection list. Later you can filter using it. For example:

| Group   | Level  |
| ------- | ------ |
| VIP     | ðŸ’Ž     |
| media   | ðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž   |
| on-site | ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž |

!!!warning
Only the first sheet will be imported.
!!!
!!!info
The excel file to be imported needed to be on the same ios device with the app. We suggest using iCloud or OneDrive to sync the file (which serves the benefit of a backup location). Or you can airdrop to the files app on your device.

:bulb: OneDrive has the additional benefit of being able to save history versions of your excel files.
